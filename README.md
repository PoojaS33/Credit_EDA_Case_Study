EDA is an important part of any data analysis, in EDA we always need to investigate the quality of our data. 
Data cleaning is just one application of EDA: 
we ask questions about whether our data meets our expectations or not.
To do data cleaning, weâ€™ll need to deploy all the tools of EDA: visualisation, transformation, and modelling.
Our goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of our data.
The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide our investigation.
When we ask a question, the question focuses our attention on a specific part of our dataset and helps us decide which graphs, models will be more usefull
